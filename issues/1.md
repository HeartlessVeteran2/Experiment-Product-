### Title: Fix CodeQL Analysis Failure - No Languages Successfully Analyzed

## Problem
The CodeQL workflow is failing because no languages are being successfully analyzed, causing the job to exit with an error.

**Failed Job:** https://github.com/Heartless-Veteran/Experiment-Product-/actions/runs/21806066440/job/62909760902

**Error Message:**
```
No languages were successfully analyzed. Exiting.
process.exit(1)
```

## Context
- The repository is 100% Kotlin according to GitHub's language detection
- The CodeQL workflow is attempting to analyze "java-kotlin" but failing
- The workflow file is located at: `dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql`
- Commit SHA: 141b703899346761020b26679158616830773809

## Root Cause
The `newLangs` array is empty after the language detection logic runs, indicating that:
1. The language detection logic may not be correctly identifying Kotlin/Java source files
2. The paths being checked may not match the actual project structure
3. CodeQL configuration may be excluding or misconfiguring Kotlin analysis

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Verify Project Structure
Ensure Kotlin source files are in standard locations:
- `src/main/kotlin/`
- `src/main/java/`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/`
- `app/src/main/java/`

### 2. Update Language Detection Logic
Modify the workflow script to properly detect Kotlin files:

```javascript
// Check for Kotlin/Java source files
if (fs.existsSync('src/main/kotlin') || 
    fs.existsSync('src/main/java') ||
    fs.existsSync('app/src/main/kotlin') ||
    fs.existsSync('app/src/main/java')) {
  newLangs.push('java-kotlin');
}
```

### 3. Review CodeQL Configuration
Check the workflow YAML configuration:
- Ensure `java-kotlin` is included in the language matrix
- Verify no exclusion patterns are blocking Kotlin files
- Confirm the CodeQL database creation is not failing silently

### 4. Alternative: Use Default Setup
Consider migrating to CodeQL's default setup which automatically detects languages:

```yaml
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
  with:
    languages: java-kotlin
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CodeQL workflow successfully detects Kotlin as a language to analyze
- [ ] The job completes without "No languages were successfully analyzed" error
- [ ] Security scanning results are visible in the Security tab
- [ ] Future commits trigger successful CodeQL analysis

## Additional Notes
This is a modernized AndroRAT Android app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and following Clean Architecture principles. The security scanning is critical for this project given its nature as a remote control application.
